How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff between two versions could help me locate the possible places where changes are made and possible bugs could be introduced.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Keep track of everything make it easier to change sections of the code back and forth, it also helps to avoid making the same mistakes again.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:have the control
    Cons:need some work and training to find the approriate commit timing

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Depending on whether multiple files are connected or not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log tracks the changes make for each version, and git diff helps to identify the actual changes made on the code.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can easily reverse to a previous version and identify the changes that cause the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Keep track of all the versions of my code.
